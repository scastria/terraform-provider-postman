Read must fill in all fields except for Id
- Id is not required because it is already known in order to call the Read function in the first place
- All fields need to be set as the read could be done as part of an import where only the id is known (UNLESS a custom import function is provided to fill in the other id related fields before the Read is called)
- Don't have to decode http response if all fields can be accessed from required input fields or decoding id

Create must set Id and computed values

Delete must set Id to empty string

Update must set Id IF a property used to create Id has been changed
